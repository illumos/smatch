Smatch

3.  Smatch vs Sparse


Section 1:  Building Smatch
---------------------------

Smatch requires sqlite3.  It requires the binaries and the C, Perl and
Python libraries for sqlite3.

apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev libdbd-sqlite3-perl

Smatch is easy to build.  Just type `make`.  There isn't an install process
right now so just run it from the build directory.


Section 2:  Using Smatch
------------------------

Smatch can be used with a cross function database. It's not mandatory to
build the database but it's a useful thing to do.  Building the database
for the kernel takes 2-3 hours on my computer.  For the kernel you build
the database with:

	cd ~/path/to/kernel_dir
	~/path/to/smatch_dir/smatch_scripts/build_kernel_data.sh

For projects other than the kernel you run Smatch with the options
"--call-tree --info --param-mapper --spammy" and finish building the
database by running the script:

	~/progs/smatch/devel/smatch_data/db/create_db.sh

Each time you rebuild the cross function database it becomes more accurate. I
normally rebuild the database every morning.

If you are running Smatch over the whole kernel you can use the following
command:

	~/progs/smatch/devel/smatch_scripts/test_kernel.sh

The test_kernel.sh script will create a .c.smatch file for every file it tests
and a combined smatch_warns.txt file with all the warnings.

If you are running Smatch just over one kernel file:

	~/progs/smatch/devel/smatch_scripts/kchecker drivers/whatever/file.c

You can also build a directory like this:

	~/progs/smatch/devel/smatch_scripts/kchecker drivers/whatever/

The kchecker script prints its warnings to stdout.

The above scripts will ensure that any ARCH or CROSS_COMPILE environment
variables are passed to kernel build system - thus allowing for the use of
Smatch with kernels that are normally built with cross-compilers.

If you are building something else (which is not the Linux kernel) then use
something like:

	make CHECK="~/progs/smatch/devel/smatch --full-path" \
		CC=~/progs/smatch/devel/smatch/cgcc | tee smatch_warns.txt

The makefile has to let people set the CC with an environment variable for that
to work, of course.


Section 3:  Smatch vs Sparse
----------------------------

Smatch uses Sparse as a C parser.  I have made a few hacks to Sparse so I
have to distribute the two together.  Sparse is released under the MIT license
and Smatch is GPLv2+.  If you make changes to Sparse please send those to the
Sparse mailing list linux-sparse@vger.kernel.org and I will pick them up from
there.  Partly I do that for licensing reasons because I don't want to pull GPL
changes into the Sparse code I re-distribute.
